### Hi there, I'm Raflyandi Alviansyah 👋

I am a Computer Science student at BINUS University specializing in **Mobile Application & Technology**. My passion lies at the intersection of **Quantitative Finance, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering.**

I am actively building solutions that leverage data and AI to solve complex problems in finance and urban environments.

### 🚀 **Featured Projects**

Here are the comprehensive projects I have engineered:

#### 1. 📈 [Quantitative Trading Research & Backtesting Platform](https://github.com/RaflyandiALV/Quantitative_trading_platform)
> *Python | Pandas | FastAPI | Algorithmic Trading*
>
> An active R&D environment for building and rigorously backtesting crypto trading strategies (Grid, Mean Reversion, Momentum, MTA). Includes a custom engine for performance analysis (Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown) against benchmarks.

#### 2. 🚦 [AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Control System](https://github.com/RaflyandiALV/AI-Urban-Traffic-Controller)
> *Python | YOLOv5 | PyTorch | Computer Vision*
>
> A full-cycle simulation of a smart traffic control system. Uses a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect vehicles in real-time and dynamically prioritizes green lights based on weighted traffic volume, reducing congestion by >20% in simulations.

#### 3. 🦖 [Open-World Dinosaur VR Experience](https://github.com/RaflyandiALV/Open-World-Dinosaur-VR-Experience)
> *C# | Unity Engine | Oculus SDK | VR Development*
>
> An immersive VR game for Oculus. I architected the core C# scripts for complex dinosaur AI behaviors (state machines, pathfinding) and physics-based hand interactions for a realistic player experience.
